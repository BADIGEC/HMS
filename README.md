This system as well as the  web application’s concept is all clear, it’s the same as real-life scenarios and well-implemented on it.

**About Hospital Management System PHP MySQL Project**
Moving on, this hospital management system project in PHP focuses mainly on dealing with the patient, doctor, and hospital records. Also, the system displays all the available hospital departments and their respective doctors. In addition, the system allows creating a patient’s personal account too. This project is divided into three categories. They are Admin Panel, Patient Panel, and Doctor Panel. In an overview of this web application, the user can simply make an appointment. Meaning, each user will have to fill up an appointment form from the client side. The form consists of fields such as patient name, address, number, and selection of department and doctor. During this procedure, the system creates personal accounts for each patient too.

**Patient’s Account**
After making an appointment for the very first time, the user can log in to the system and check their appointment status. By default, each appointment is set to pending status. Which later, the doctor should approve or reject it in order to start their treatment process. Also, the patient can remove their appointments anytime. From a patient’s panel, he/she can update their profile, view treatment records, and prescription records. Under the treatment section, a patient can view all the records such as treatment type, doctor’s name, date, and total charge. Similarly, the prescription section displays the date, name, and quantity of the medicines with the total bill charge.

**Doctor’s Panel**
Each doctor will have their own personal account which lets them access the system. Here, the doctor can view all the pending appointments. Each appointment has options that allow the doctor to approve or reject them. After approving the appointment, the doctor can view the patient’s profile and appointment record. For the rest, the doctor has to maintain each by filling up their treatments. In order to set a treatment record, the user has to select a treatment type, description, date, and upload treatment files. After the completion of treatment records, the doctor can now proceed towards the prescription section. For the prescription, the doctor has to select available medicine, date, and enter quantity and dosage. After the submission of the prescription record, the system generates the total bill for the patient.

**Manage Visiting Hours, Patients, Income Report, and Services**
Additionally, a doctor can set up their visiting hours by selecting starting and ending times. In terms of patients record, the doctor can view all the available patients with their respective information. When comes to income report, each doctor will have their own consultancy charge. And these consultancy charges are shown with respect to their number of patients. As a result, these sections will display the doctor’s total earnings. Besides, the doctor can list their services which include their respective department’s attachment to the patient’s name, and treatment details.

**Admin Panel**
On the other hand, the admin has full control over the system. He/she can view all the existing records of the hospital. An admin can manage patients, doctors, their departments, treatment types, and medical records. An admin has the right to register a doctor’s account. For this, the admin has to set the doctor’s account under various hospital departments too. The admin can view all the appointment records too. Also, the admin has to maintain billing records for each patient’s treatment. In order to maintain the payment of each patient, the user has to enter the discount amount and the reason for it. After the payment, the patient can view all the reports from their own personal accounts.

**Manage Hospital Services**
Here, the hospital services consist of departments, treatment types, and medicine. For the addition of hospital departments, he/she has to enter the department name, description, and status. These departments are essential during the registration of doctors as well as patient’s appointment. In addition to it, the admin has to set up all the treatment types. For this, the admin has to enter the treatment name, description, total charge, and status. Similarly, the same goes with the medicine section where the user has to enter name, cost, description, and status. Besides, the admin can have a summary of their total patients, doctor, and total hospital earnings.
